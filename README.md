## Law Firm Management System Documentation

It is a simple but comprenhensive backend system, usign the best code practices, making ready for deploy applications. Frontend still in development, right now I am finishing the backend functionalities, the main point of this project is to improve my logging, caching, cors and unit testing, I am aiming to create a solid structure of programming for future projects. ASP.NET is being very useful but challeging, it is a bit different from what I am use to but more complete than node.js.

### Key Functionalities

1. **Case Management**

   - **Create, Update, Delete, and Retrieve Cases**: The system allows users to manage cases efficiently. Cases can be created, updated, deleted, and retrieved with ease.
   - **Case Assignments**: Lawyers and staff can be assigned to specific cases.
   - **Case Status Tracking**: Track the status of each case through its lifecycle.

2. **Document Management**

   - **Document Upload and Storage**: Users can upload and store case-related documents.
   - **Document Retrieval**: Retrieve documents associated with specific cases.
   - **Document Deletion**: Remove documents that are no longer needed.

3. **Messaging**

   - **Internal Messaging**: Allows users to send messages within the system, facilitating communication between team members.
   - **Message History**: Maintain a history of messages for each case.

4. **Notifications**

   - **Real-time Notifications**: Notify users of important events and updates in real-time.
   - **Email Notifications**: Send email alerts for critical updates and reminders.

5. **User Authentication and Authorization**
   - **JWT Authentication**: Secure the API endpoints using JWT Bearer tokens.
   - **Role-based Authorization**: Implement role-based access control to restrict access to specific functionalities.

### Improvements and Focus

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implemented Serilog for comprehensive logging and monitoring of application events.
- **Caching**: Used IMemoryCache to cache frequently accessed data, improving application performance.
- **API Documentation**: Integrated Swagger for API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API endpoints.
- **Security**: Emphasized security by enforcing strong password policies and using JWT for secure authentication.
- **Scalability**: Designed the system with scalability in mind, using Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL for efficient data management.

### Backend Technologies

- **ASP.NET Core**: The core framework for building the backend services.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Used for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Serilog**: For logging application events and errors.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For API documentation and testing.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication.
- **IMemoryCache**: For caching frequently accessed data.
