# üìö Law Firm Management System

Welcome to the Law Firm Management System! This project is a comprehensive backend solution aimed at streamlining legal case management for law firms. The system is designed using ASP.NET Core following best coding practices, making it ready for production deployment.

# üìù Project Overview

The Law Firm Management System provides a robust backend architecture to support the operational needs of law firms, including case tracking, document management, and internal communication. The primary focus of this project is to refine and enhance skills in:

Logging and Monitoring
Caching Strategies
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Management
Unit Testing and Code Quality
Why ASP.NET Core?
ASP.NET Core was chosen for its comprehensive features, powerful tooling, and strong support for scalable web applications. Although challenging compared to my usual Node.js projects, it has proven to be a more feature-rich and robust choice.

Note: The frontend for this project is still under development. Stay tuned for updates!

# üöÄ Key Features

1. Case Management
CRUD Operations: Create, update, delete, and retrieve cases efficiently.
Case Assignments: Assign cases to lawyers and staff members with role-based permissions.
Status Tracking: Monitor the status of each case throughout its lifecycle.
2. Document Management
Upload & Storage: Securely upload and store case-related documents.
Document Retrieval: Retrieve documents linked to specific cases.
Document Deletion: Delete documents when they are no longer needed.
3. Messaging System
Internal Messaging: Enables communication between team members within the system.
Message History: Keeps a log of all messages exchanged per case.
4. Notifications
Real-time Notifications: Uses SignalR to push real-time notifications for important updates.
Email Notifications: Sends email alerts for critical updates and reminders.
5. User Authentication and Authorization
JWT Authentication: Secures API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Role-based Access Control: Implements roles (Admin, Lawyer, Staff) to control access to specific features.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Backend Framework: ASP.NET Core 7.0
Database: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core
Caching: IMemoryCache for efficient data retrieval
Logging: Serilog for detailed logging and monitoring
API Documentation: Swagger for comprehensive API documentation
Real-time Communication: SignalR for real-time notifications

# üîç Improvements and Focus Areas
This project places a strong emphasis on the following areas:

1. Logging and Monitoring
Serilog is integrated for comprehensive logging of application events. Logs include request details, error messages, and performance metrics.
2. Caching
IMemoryCache is used to store frequently accessed data, reducing load times and improving performance.
3. CORS Management
Configured CORS policies to allow secure cross-origin requests, making the API accessible from different frontend applications.
4. Unit Testing
Extensive unit tests have been written using xUnit to ensure code quality and reliability. Key functionalities, including authentication and case management, are thoroughly tested.

# üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations
Enforces strong password policies for user accounts.
Uses JWT Bearer Authentication to secure API endpoints.
Protects against common web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
# üìà Scalability and Future Enhancements
The system is built with scalability in mind:

Uses Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL for efficient data management.

Implements Dependency Injection (DI) for better maintainability and testability.

Designed to easily integrate additional services like payment processing or client portals in the future.

# ü§ù Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or want to report a bug, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

# Development Guidelines

Follow the existing coding standards and practices.

Ensure all changes are covered by unit tests.

Update the API documentation with any new or modified endpoints.
